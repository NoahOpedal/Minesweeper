# Minesweeper
Simple minesweeper implementation in python using pygame

Use spacebar to mark mines, click tiles to reveal them. If a mine is clicked the program will terminate. Pressing the spacebar while hovering over a tile which has the appropriate number of mines around it marked will reveal the remaining tiles around it.
